# YDMS Frontend Skeleton

A minimal Vite + React + Ant Design setup for the YDMS admin interface.

## Getting started

1. Ensure Node.js 18+ and pnpm/npm/yarn are available.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Visit http://localhost:5173 to see the Ant Design hello world page.

The project structure mirrors the planned architecture so additional pages,
components and API hooks can be layered on during subsequent iterations.
